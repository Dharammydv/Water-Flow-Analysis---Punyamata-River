# Water-Flow-Analysis---Punyamata-River
Conducted a detailed hydrological and hydraulic analysis of the Punyamata River using HEC-RAS and EPANET to study flow characteristics, predict potential flood zones, and optimize water resource management. The project focused on understanding flow behavior under varying discharge conditions, contributing to sustainable river basin planning.
